# Fine-tuning a pre-trained PET-MAD universal model for specific applications

## Example 00: Basic usage of the PET-MAD model

This example shows how to use the existing pre-trained PET-MAD model through the ASE calculator

### Steps to Run
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `basic-usage.ipynb`.

2. Load the MAD dataset sample using ASE and initialize the PET-MAD calculator.

3. Run the evaluation on the dataset to compute energies and forces.

4. Plot the predictions pairplots to visualize the model performance.
